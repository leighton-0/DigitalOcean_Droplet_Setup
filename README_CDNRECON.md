# CDNRECON: Peel back the layers of the web
CDNRECON is a tool that tries to find the origin or backend IP address of a website protected by a CDNs reverse proxy. This tool can be useful in penetration testing to identify the true target IP and in reconnaissance to identify the hosting provider or data center of a website. You can also simply use it to test your own website for any leaks.

It's important to note that CDNRECON is a tool for educational purpose and should not be used for any illegal activities. Additionally, it's not guaranteed to be 100% accurate and some websites may have additional security measures in place to prevent this information from being revealed. The author will not be responsible for any misuse of the above information.

Short summary of it's functionality:
- Identify the origin IP behind a CDN's reverse proxy
- Display information about the hosting provider and data center of the website
- Support for both HTTP and HTTPS

A more in-depth chronological order of what it does:
- Checks the target domain nameservers
- Dumps DNS records with DNSDumpster
- Gets subdomains from the target domains SSL certificate
- Gets subdomains with SecurityTrails API
- Checks common subdomains and gets their IP addresses
- Checks if any of the IP addresses belong to Cloudflare
- Checks if any of the IP addresses belong to Akamai
- Checks if any of the IP addresses are using the AkamaiGHost server
- Optionally returns data from Shodan for possibly leaked IP addresses
- Optionally writes the results to target.com-results.txt file

 Checking the nameservers, common subdomains and their IP addresses
